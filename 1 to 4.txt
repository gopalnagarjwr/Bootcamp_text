Rat Count House
The function accepts two positive integers ‘r’ and ‘unit’ and a positive integer array ‘arr’ of
size ‘n’ as its argument ‘r’ represents the number of rats present in an area, ‘unit’ is the
amount of food each rat consumes and each ith element of array ‘arr’ represents the amount
of food present in ‘i+1’ house number, where 0 <= i
Note:
a)Return -1 if the array is null
b)Return 0 if the total amount of food from all houses is not sufficient for all the rats.
c)Computed values lie within the integer range.
Example:
Input:
->r: 7
->unit: 2
->n: 8
->arr: 2 8 3 5 7 4 1 2
output :
4
Explanation:
Total amount of food required for all rats = r * unit
= 7 * 2 = 14.
The amount of food in 1st houses = 2+8+3+5 = 18. Since, amount of food in 1st 4 houses is
sufficient for all the rats. Thus, output is 4.

Problem Statement
You are given a function,
Int MaxExponents (int a , int b);
You have to find and return the number between ‘a’ and ‘b’ ( range inclusive on both ends)
which has the maximum exponent of 2.
The algorithm to find the number with maximum exponent of 2 between the given range is
1.Loop between ‘a’ and ‘b’. Let the looping variable be ‘i’.
2.Find the exponent (power) of 2 for each ‘i’ and store the number with maximum exponent
of 2 so faqrd in a variable , let say ‘max’. Set ‘max’ to ‘i’ only if ‘i’ has more exponent of 2
than ‘max’.
3.Return ‘max’.
Assumption: a <b
Note: If two or more numbers in the range have the same exponents of 2 , return the small
number.
Example
Input:
7
12
Output:
8
Explanation:
Exponents of 2 in:
7-0
8-3
9-0
10-1
11-0
12-2
Hence maximum exponent if two is of 8

In a theater, there is a discount scheme announced where one gets a 10% discount
on the total cost of tickets when there is a bulk booking of more than 20 tickets, and
a discount of 2% on the total cost of tickets if a special coupon card is submitted.
Develop a program to find the total cost as per the scheme. The cost of the k class
ticket is Rs.75 and q class is Rs.150. Refreshments can also be opted by paying an
additional of Rs. 50 per member.
Hint: k and q and You have to book minimum of 5 tickets and maximum of 40 at a
time. If fails display “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”. If circle is given a
value other than ‘k’ or ‘q’ the output should be “Invalid Input”.
The ticket cost should be printed exactly to two decimal places.

Problem Statement – Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your
truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the
tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption
and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If
the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the
inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is
0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]
The result should be with two decimal place.To get two decimal place refer the
below-mentioned print statement :
float cost=670.23;
System.out.printf(“You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip”,cost);
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
20
Enter the distance covered
150
Sample Output 1:
Liters/100KM
13.33
Miles/gallons
17.64
Explanation:
For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters,
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons
(20*0.2642)=5.284,
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64
Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
-5
Sample Output 2:
-5 is an Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank

Enter the distance covered

A party has been organised on cruise. The party is organised for a limited time(T). The
number of guests entering (E[i]) and leaving (L[i]) the party at every hour is represented as
elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of guests present on the
cruise at any given instance within T hours.
Example 1:
Input :
a)5 -> Value of T
b)[7,0,5,1,3] -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by
new line
c)[1,2,1,3,4] -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element is separate by new
line.
Output :
8 -> Maximum number of guests on cruise at an instance.
Explanation:
1st hour:
Entry : 7 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 6
2nd hour :
Entry : 0 Exit : 2
No. of guests on ship : 6-2=4
Hour 3:
Entry: 5 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 4+5-1=8
Hour 4:
Entry : 1 Exit : 3
No. of guests on ship : 8+1-3=6
Hour 5:
Entry : 3 Exit: 4
No. of guests on ship: 6+3-4=5
Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 8.
